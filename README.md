<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I am Rodrigo Vieira</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate developer and DevOps enthusiast from Brazil</h3>

🌍 Hello! My name is Rodrigo and I am 38 years old, originally from Brazil. With a dynamic professional career whose journey has taken me across continents, from the soccer field and international fashion runways to the world of software engineering and cloud infrastructure.

⚽ My early years were shaped by dedication and adaptability. I started out as a professional soccer player (ages 14–19), which taught me discipline and teamwork.

👔 After that, I spent a decade (ages 21–31) traveling the world as a fashion model, living in cities like São Paulo, Mexico City, Seoul, Los Angeles, New York City, and Washington D.C. These experiences gave me cultural fluency, resilience, and the ability to thrive in fast-changing environments.

💻 After returning to Brazil, I decided to pursue my passion for technology and earned a bachelor's degree in **Information Systems** (Sistemas de Informação), which I completed in December 2020. Since then, I've been focused on building my career in DevOps and Software Development, embracing continuous learning and hands-on experimentation.
